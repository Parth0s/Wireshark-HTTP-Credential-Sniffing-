## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. A **Flask server** is hosted on Kali Linux to accept HTTP POST login requests.
2. Wireshark captures the traffic on `eth0`.
3. A victim device (browser) sends credentials using HTTP (not HTTPS).
4. The POST data, including `username` and `password`, is visible in plaintext in the capture.
5. The capture is filtered using:
   ```wireshark
   **http.request.method == "POST"**
6. Credentials are shown under:
     ** HTML Form URL Encoded: application/x-www-form-urlencoded**
